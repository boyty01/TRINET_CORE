# TRINET_CORE

## This is in early development and is not functional


 TriNet server app. Part of the TriNet smart home controller family.

TriNet is a personal project. As an avid tech hound, I naturally love smart devices.  What I don't love is having to navigate a hundred different apps to control individual devices. 

TriNet is a personal solution that (will) centralise all of my smart devices into a single android/iOS app that ultimately simplifies controlling my home devices. TriNet Core is the server application that the TriNet Client apps will synchronise with for persistent, shared config & communication route with smart home devices.

The concept of TriNet, is to amalgamate all possible communication routes with Smart Devices,  Client-to-Device, Server-to-Device and ManufacturerApi-to-Device.

TriNet Client is required for interfacing with Core.
